A thread-safe Redux-style state management library implemented in Rust.

## Overview

rs-store provides a predictable state container inspired by Redux, featuring thread-safe state management with support for reducers, subscribers, and async actions through Thunk. Unlike traditional Redux, rs-store's reducers can produce side effects, providing more flexibility in state management.

## Features

- ðŸ”’ Thread-safe state management
- ðŸ“¢ Publisher/Subscriber pattern for state changes
- ðŸ”„ Support for async operations via Thunk actions
- ðŸ“Š Side effect handling in reducers
- ðŸ“Š Backpressure handling with configurable policies
- ðŸŽ¯ Bounded channel size with sync channels
- ðŸ§ª Comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rs-store = "0.10.1"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use rs_store::{Store, CalcState, CalcAction, CalcReducer, CalcSubscriber};
use std::{thread, sync::Arc};

impl Reducer<CalcState> for CalcReducer {
    fn reduce(&self, state: &CalcState, action: &CalcAction) -> Option<CalcState> {
        match action {
            CalcAction::Add(value) => {
                println!("Adding value: {}", value);
                Some(CalcState { value: state.value + value })
            }
            CalcAction::Subtract(value) => {
                println!("Subtracting value: {}", value);
                Some(CalcState { value: state.value - value })
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Initialize store with default reducer
    let store = Store::<CalcState, CalcAction>::new(Box::new(CalcReducer::default()));

    // Add subscriber
    store.add_subscriber(Arc::new(CalcSubscriber::default()));
    
    // Dispatch actions
    store.dispatch(CalcAction::Add(1));

    thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
    store.add_subscriber(Arc::new(CalcSubscriber::default()));
    store.dispatch(CalcAction::Subtract(1));

    // Clean up
    store.stop();
}
```

## Side Effects in Reducers

Unlike traditional Redux implementations, rs-store allows reducers to produce side effects directly. This means reducers can produce asynchronous operations.

This design choice provides more flexibility while maintaining predictable state management.
